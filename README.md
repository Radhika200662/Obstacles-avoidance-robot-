# Obstacles-avoidance-robot-
An obstacle avoidance robot is an autonomous robot that detects and avoids obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. It continuously measures the distance to nearby objects, and when an obstacle is detected, the Arduino controls the motors to change direction. This project demonstrates robotics, sensor integration, and autonomous navigation principles.
